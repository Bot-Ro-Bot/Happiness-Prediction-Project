  * Regression with KNN
  * Lasso Regression
  * Ridge Regression

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive statistical analysis aimed at understanding the diverse factors influencing the happiness levels within populations worldwide. 
Happiness, often regarded as a subjective well-being measure, is influenced by a multitude of socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. This project endeavors to explore and model these factors to predict and gain insights into the determinants of happiness scores across different regions and nations. Through meticulous data exploration, feature analysis, and predictive modeling, this project seeks to uncover patterns, correlations, and predictive relationships that contribute significantly to happiness levels. 

## Objective
Leveraging advanced statistical learning techniques, this project aims to build models capable of predicting happiness scores based on various indicators, thus shedding light on the intricate dynamics influencing the happiness of societies.

## Methodology
An exploratory analysis of associated factors for happiness is done. Each factor (or predictor in this case) is studied and compared with each other and the prediction (happiness score) is done. 

## Results
